1. SQA Tools

These are technologies and platforms that support various aspects of software quality assurance and control:
A. Static Analysis Tools

    Purpose: Analyze source code without executing it.

    Examples: SonarQube, ESLint, Prettier

    Benefits: Detect code smells, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues early.

B. Test Automation Tools

    Purpose: Automate the execution of tests and comparison of actual vs. expected results.

    Examples: Selenium, JUnit, Cucumber, ...

    Benefits: Increase testing efficiency, support regression testing.

C. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Tools

    Purpose: Automate code integration, testing, and deployment.

    Examples: GitHub Actions (SonarCloud) - Possible alternatives: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps

    Benefits: Reduce integration issues, accelerate delivery pipelines.

D. Performance Testing Tools

    Purpose: Evaluate system behavior under load or stress.

    Examples: JS load tests (Prometheus, k6) - Possible alternatives: JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner

    Benefits: Identify bottlenecks, ensure scalability.

E. Security Testing Tools (Not needed but if so these could be the choices)

    Purpose: Detect vulnerabilities in software.

    Examples: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk

    Benefits: Improve software security posture.

F. Code Review & Collaboration Tools

    Purpose: Facilitate peer review and feedback.

    Examples: GitHub (Used), Bitbucket, Crucible

    Benefits: Enhance code quality through team-based insights.

G. Defect & Issue Tracking Tools

    Purpose: Track bugs and improvements.

    Examples: Jira (Used - Together with xray), Bugzilla, Azure Boards

    Benefits: Improve transparency and traceability of quality issues.


2. SQA Practices

These are processes and methodologies that ensure quality is built into the product from the beginning:
A. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

    Definition: Write tests before code to drive design.

    Benefit: Ensures code meets requirements early.

B. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

    Definition: Define application behavior in business-readable language.

    Tools: Cucumber (Used), SpecFlow

    Benefit: Aligns development with business needs.

C. Shift-Left Testing

    Definition: Move testing earlier in the lifecycle.

    Benefit: Detect defects sooner, reduce costs.

D. Continuous Testing

    Definition: Run automated tests continuously as part of the delivery pipeline.

    Benefit: Rapid feedback, supports Agile and DevOps.

E. Code Reviews & Pair Programming

    Definition: Systematic examination of code with peers.

    Benefit: Knowledge sharing, early defect detection.

F. Risk-Based Testing

    Definition: Prioritize testing based on risk exposure.

    Benefit: Optimize effort on critical areas.

G. Metrics and Quality Monitoring

    Definition: Track quality indicators (e.g., code coverage, defect density).

    Benefit: Data-driven decision making.

H. Compliance and Standards Adherence

    Definition: Follow industry standards (e.g., ISO 25010, CMMI, IEEE).                

    Benefit: Maintain quality benchmarks, especially in regulated industries.
